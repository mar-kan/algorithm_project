# A. Bottleneck autoencoder

Bottleneck autoencoder that compresses vectors into smaller ones. Size for compression is inputed.

# B. Manhattan distance

Search for the nearest neighbour of the images of the dataset using the Manhattan distance algorithm.

There are 4 searches implemented: 

      Heuristic searches for the original dimension dataset and the compressed one.
      Approximate searches for both dimensions.
    
    
# C. Earth mover's distance (EMD)   

Heuristic search for the 10 closest neighbours of each image of the dataset.

-------------------------------

For all the parts of the project the dataset used is the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

For the reduced dimensions, the datasets used are generated from part A of the project.
